And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.31. and, behold, it was very good] The work of the six daysâ\\x80\\x99 Creation having been completed, God, as it were, contemplates the universe both in its details and in its entirety. That which He saw to be â\\x80\\x9cgood,â\\x80\\x9d on each separate day, was but a fragment; that which He sees to be â\\x80\\x9cvery good,â\\x80\\x9d on the sixth day, is the vast ordered whole, in which the separate parts are combined. The Divine approval of the material universe constitutes one of the most instructive traits of the Hebrew cosmogony. According to it, matter is not something hostile to God, independent of Him, or inherently evil, but made by Him, ordered by Him, good in itself, and good in its relation to the purpose and plan of the Creator. The adjective â\\x80\\x9cgoodâ\\x80\\x9d should not therefore be limited in meaning to the sense of â\\x80\\x9csuitable,â\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cfitting.â\\x80\\x9d There is nothing â\\x80\\x9cevilâ\\x80\\x9d in the Divinely-created universe: it is â\\x80\\x9cvery goodâ\\x80\\x9d (LXX ÎºÎ±Î»á½° Î»Î¯Î±Î½: Lat. valde bona).The Cambridge Bible for Schools and CollegesText Courtesy of BibleSupport.com.

      "('Genesis 2:25', ['And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.25. This verse by one simple illustration describes the condition of the man and the woman in the garden. It is not that of moral perfection, but that of the innocence and ignorance of childhood. The untried innocence of the child does not possess the sense of shame: the depravity of vice forfeits it. The sense of shame is the shadow which temptation to sin throws across the pathway of purity.NOTE ON THE COSMOGONIES OF GENESISThe Book of Genesis contains two Cosmogonies: (1) the earlier and simpler one, that of Genesis 2:4 bâ\\x80\\x9325 J, (2) the later and more systematic one, that of Genesis 1:1 to Genesis 2:4 a P.(1) The distinctive features of the earlier one suggest a scene familiar to dwellers in the desert. The earth is barren and dry: there is as yet no rain to make it fruitful, no man to till it (Genesis 2:5). A stream1[5] issues â\\x80\\x9cfrom the earthâ\\x80\\x9d; it irrigates â\\x80\\x9cthe whole face of the groundâ\\x80\\x9d (Genesis 2:6). Jehovah forms â\\x80\\x9cmanâ\\x80\\x9d out of the dust, and breathes life into him (Genesis 2:7). He causes him to dwell in a garden of rich soil and fruitful trees (Genesis 2:8-17). He forms â\\x80\\x9cthe beasts of the fieldâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cthe fowls of the airâ\\x80\\x9d to be manâ\\x80\\x99s companions (Genesis 2:18-20). But they give no true companionship: and Jehovah, casting â\\x80\\x9cmanâ\\x80\\x9d into a deep sleep, takes out of him a rib, and forms â\\x80\\x9cwomanâ\\x80\\x9d to be manâ\\x80\\x99s companion (Genesis 2:21-25).[5] â\\x80\\x9cStreamâ\\x80\\x9d: R.V. â\\x80\\x9cmist.â\\x80\\x9d See note in loc.The process of formation is orderly: (1) dry earth, (2) water, (3) man, (4) vegetation, (5) animals, (6) woman. Jehovah is the maker of all. Man is, in all, the object of Jehovahâ\\x80\\x99s care and solicitude. The scene of the garden is that of an oasis teeming with life and vegetation.(2) The later and more elaborate Cosmogony (Genesis 1:1 to Genesis 2:4 a) is, undoubtedly, ultimately derived from the alluvial region of Babylonia. At the first, there is a primordial watery chaos, over which â\\x80\\x9cbroodsâ\\x80\\x9d the quickening â\\x80\\x9cspirit of Godâ\\x80\\x9d (Genesis 2:2). Then ensue six days of Creation. On the first, God creates the light, causing day and night (Genesis 2:3). On the second, He â\\x80\\x9cmakesâ\\x80\\x9d the â\\x80\\x9cfirmament, or solid expanse of heaven, which parts asunder the waters above and the waters below (Genesis 2:7). On the third day, God collects the lower waters into seas, and makes the earth appear, and clothes it with vegetation (Genesis 2:9-13). On the fourth day, He makes the sun, moon, and stars; and â\\x80\\x9csetsâ\\x80\\x9d them in the â\\x80\\x9cfirmament,â\\x80\\x9d to rule over the day and the night (Genesis 2:14-19). On the fifth day, He causes the water and the air to bring forth water-animals and winged things (Genesis 2:20-23). On the sixth day, God â\\x80\\x9cmakesâ\\x80\\x9d the animals of the earth; and, finally, â\\x80\\x9ccreatesâ\\x80\\x9d man, â\\x80\\x9cmale and female,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cin the image of Godâ\\x80\\x9d (Genesis 2:24-25).In this Cosmogony there are certain points of resemblance to the Babylonian Cosmogony contained in the Seven Tables of Creation, in which Marduk, the god of light, overthrows Tiamat, the dragon-goddess of the watery chaos, sets up the luminaries of heaven, and makes Man 1:2[6]. The following table, taken from Gordonâ\\x80\\x99s Early Traditions of Genesis (p. 51), will shew all the chief points of resemblance, and will also make it clear that the Biblical story is not a mere reproduction of the Babylonian myth.[6] See Appendix A (book comments).Genesis 1.\\u2003\\u2003Seven Tables.i. The emergence of light (Genesis 1:3 f.).\\u2003\\u2003i.\\u2003\\u2003The appearance of Marduk, god of light (ii. 97).ii.

In the details of the account, the division of the waters above and below the firmament seems to correspond closely to the cleaving of Tiamat into two pieces, to form the heaven and the earth; and the setting of the heavenly bodies as â\\x80\\x9csigns,â\\x80\\x9d for the determining of seasons, days, and years, and for ruling the day and night, presents a feature of striking similarity to the Babylonian story.The Genesis Cosmogony has dispensed with the grotesque and often unlovely and confusing details of the Babylonian mythology. For example, whereas man is made out of the compound of Mardukâ\\x80\\x99s blood and the dust of the earth, the truth, which underlies this crude representation, is stated by the Hebrew writer in the simple words, â\\x80\\x9cAnd God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likenessâ\\x80\\x9d (Genesis 1:26).The two main ideas that run through this Hebrew Cosmogony are:(1) God is the One Almighty Creative Power; whether calling into being light (Genesis 1:3), the firmament (Genesis 1:6-7), the heavenly bodies (Genesis 1:16-17), and man (Genesis 1:27), or causing vegetation to come forth from the earth (Genesis 1:11-12), fish from the water (Genesis 1:20-21), animals from the earth (Genesis 1:24-25).(2) The sequence in the creative acts is an orderly ascent from one stage to another, progressing from amorphous chaos to man as the crown of creation. At first, there is darkness and watery mass. Light displaces darkness; a solid dome of heaven separates the waters; the waters are collected; earth emerges, and out of the earth vegetation; the heavenly bodies are bearers of light; the waters and the air produce their living creatures; and, lastly, the earth produces the beasts; and, to crown the whole work, God creates man.It is progress from chaos to order; from elemental to complex; from inorganic to organic; from lifeless matter to vegetable; from vegetable to animal, and, finally, to human life.The Six DaysThe most distinctive feature in the Hebrew Cosmogony of Genesis 1:1 to Genesis 2:4 a is the scheme of Six Days Creation. The orderly arrangement of chronological material is characteristic of the style of P. The stages of the Divine Creative work lent themselves to be distributed over Six Days. But, according to the religious thought of the devout Israelite, the Seventh Day must from the first have been a day of rest, and the Divine example alone could have communicated to the observance of the Sabbath its supreme seal of sanctity.It is noteworthy that the only two passages in the Old Testament in which reference is made to the â\\x80\\x9csix days workâ\\x80\\x9d of Creation, are Exodus 20:11; Exodus 31:17, both of which are probably based upon Pâ\\x80\\x99s narrative. (See Commentaries by McNeile and Driver, in loc.) The Six Days Creation, followed by the Seventh Day of Rest, are distinctively Israelite and not Babylonian features. There is nothing corresponding to them in the Babylonian myth. The Seven Tables of Creation are not arranged in any sequence of days.The Creative works of the Six Days have been classified in different ways.(1) Thomas Aquinas divided them into three â\\x80\\x9copera distinctionisâ\\x80\\x9d and three â\\x80\\x9copera ornatus.â\\x80\\x9dOpera distinctionis.\\u2003\\u2003Opera ornatus.1st Day.\\u2003\\u2003Light.\\u2003\\u20034th Day.\\u2003\\u2003Heavenly Bodies.2nd Day.\\u2003\\u2003The Firmament.\\u2003\\u20035th Day.\\u2003\\u2003Fishes and Birds.3rd Day.\\u2003\\u2003Sea, Land, and Vegetation.\\u2003\\u20036th Day.\\u2003\\u2003Cattle, Beasts, and Man.(2) Many modern scholars, e.g. Wellhausen and Gunkel, suggest that the Cosmogony originally told of eight creative works, and that these have been arranged in Pâ\\x80\\x99s scheme of â\\x80\\x9csix daysâ\\x80\\x9d:Elements.\\u2003\\u2003Inhabitants.1.\\u2003\\u2003Light.\\u2003\\u20035.\\u2003\\u2003Luminaries.2.\\u2003\\u2003Heaven.\\u2003\\u20036.\\u2003\\u2003Fishes.3.\\u2003\\u2003Sea.\\u2003\\u20037.\\u2003\\u2003Birds.4.\\u2003\\u2003Vegetation.\\u2003\\u20038.\\u2003\\u2003Animals and Man.(3) The endeavour to find any exact symmetry of parallelism between the works of the first three days and the works of the second three days must be abandoned. Roughly speaking, it may suffice to say, to quote Driver, that â\\x80\\x9cthe first three days are days of preparation, the next three are days of accomplishment.â\\x80\\x9d But the following facts are noteworthy. (a) Each group of three days contains four creative acts: (b) the third day, in each group, has two creative acts assigned to it: (c) the creation of light on the first day has corresponding to it on the fourth day the creation of the â\\x80\\x9clight-bearers,â\\x80\\x9d or heavenly bodies: (d) the separation of the waters, on the second day, by the making of the firmament, seems to correspond with the creation, on the fifth, of the creatures of the sea and of the fowls â\\x80\\x9cthat fly above the earth in the open firmament of heavenâ\\x80\\x9d (Genesis 1:20): (e) whereas, on the third day, the dry land appears, and vegetable life is made, it is on the sixth day that the animals of the earth, and man, are created; while the herbs, grasses, and fruits of the third dayâ\\x80\\x99s creation are the appointed food (Genesis 1:30), both of animals and of mankind.1st Day.\\u2003\\u2003Light.2nd Day.\\u2003\\u2003The Firmament, separating between the waters above and below.3rd Day.\\u2003\\u2003(a) Formation of the Sea and the Earth, and (b) of the Vegetable World.4th Day.\\u2003\\u2003Heavenly Bodies.5th Day.\\u2003\\u2003Fowls of the Air, and Water Animals.6th Day.\\u2003\\u2003(a) Animals of the Earth, (b) Mankind.The Cosmogonies and Science and ReligionEvery Cosmogony expresses, under the form of imagery, the childlike answers of a people in its earliest phases of civilization to the questionings of the human mind as to the origin of the world and of life. No Cosmogony, therefore, can be expected to give any but naÃ¯ve, crude, and simple explanations of the deep mysteries of the universe.The Biblical Cosmogonies only differ from other Cosmogonies in this respect. They reproduce the early beliefs of the Israelite people respecting the Origin of the World and of the Human Race in the form of narrative which, however simple and childlike, is devoid of any taint of polytheism or degrading superstition, and is capable of conveying the profoundest truths respecting God, the Universe, and Mankind.Unquestionably, they present to us the physical science of their age. And, by comparison with other Cosmogonies, the statement, contained in the first two chapters of Genesis, surpasses in dignity, lucidity, and simplicity that which is to be found in any other ancient literature. It is no exaggeration to say that the picture, which the first chapter of Genesis presents of the orderly progress out of primordial chaos, and of the successive stages in the creation of vegetation, fishes, birds, mammals, and man, is unrivalled for its combination of simplicity, grandeur, and truth. It contains, in principle, though, of course, without exactitude in detail, the thought which is contained in the modern idea of evolution.Judged by the standards of modern knowledge, the Cosmogonies of Genesis are wholly defective. They present to us pictures, accounting for the origin of things, which vividly corresponded with the Semitic thought of their age and country, but which from the point of view of science are devoid of any value.For instance, in Genesis 2, the formation of man out of the dust of the earth, and of woman out of manâ\\x80\\x99s rib, is the symbolism of primitive legend, not actual fact.In Genesis 1, the conception of the universe, as in the O.T. generally, is geocentric. The sun, moon and stars are formed after the earth, and attached to the â\\x80\\x9cfirmament.â\\x80\\x9d The â\\x80\\x9cfirmamentâ\\x80\\x9d of the heaven is a solid dome above which are vast reservoirs of water. The vegetation of the earth appears before the formation of the sun. â\\x80\\x9cSix Daysâ\\x80\\x9d account for the origin of the whole universe. Two days are assigned for the formation of all forms of animal life and of mankind.These are ideas which, however beautifully expressed, belong to the childhood of the enquiring thought of mankind. They have had their value in helping to supply the science of the Christian world in pre-scientific days. In this respect they have served their time. We derive our knowledge of the structure of the globe, of the universe, of the stars, of the succession of animal life, of the antiquity of man, not from these two chapters of Genesis, but from the continually progressive teaching of modern science. Modern science is based upon the skilled and minute observations of men of genius and highly trained intellect. The astronomical discoveries of Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton, reinforced by the philosophical teaching of Baconâ\\x80\\x99s Novum Organon, have revolutionized the natural sciences. The pre-Copernican conception of the universe has passed for ever away.It is to be remembered that to the Israelite writers â\\x80\\x9cthe realm of natural sciences,â\\x80\\x9d as we call them, had no existence. The universe had come into being by the Will of God. The phenomena of Nature were the manifestations of His handiwork. God was the immediate fashioner of all from the beginning. The religion of Jehovah had chased away the Nature Deities of the heathen nations. The Spirit of God is the source of all life: every law of Nature is the direct fulfilment of Divine command. To the Israelite writer â\\x80\\x9creligionâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cscienceâ\\x80\\x9d are one. The gaps in human knowledge are filled up with the poetry of primitive imagination; but this is never allowed to conflict with the pure monotheism of Israel. Neither the world, nor any creature, nor the heavenly bodies, are identified with the Divine Being. Nothing in the universe has any existence save through the Will of God. There is no independent, no hostile, deity. God has willed and made all; and, therefore, He is able to pronounce all to be â\\x80\\x9cvery good.â\\x80\\x9d The Hebrew Cosmogonies testify to a God who is not only omnipotent, but whose works proclaim His praise as the God of order, of progress, and of love.The Cambridge Bible for Schools and CollegesText Courtesy of BibleSupport.com.

      "('Genesis 3:24', ['So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.24. So he drove out] The expulsion from the garden is repeated in this verse in stronger terms. In Genesis 3:23, it was â\\x80\\x9csent him forthâ\\x80\\x9d (LXX á¼\\x90Î¾Î±Ï\\x80Î\\xadÏ\\x83Ï\\x84ÎµÎ¹Î»ÎµÎ½, Lat. emisit): here, it is â\\x80\\x9cdrove outâ\\x80\\x9d (LXX á¼\\x90Î¾Î\\xadÎ²Î±Î»Îµ, Lat. ejecit). Though there is a repetition which may possibly imply different narratives combined together, the milder tone of Genesis 3:23 is connected with, the description of manâ\\x80\\x99s vocation to work, the sterner tone of Genesis 3:24 expresses the exclusion of sinful beings from the privileges of the Divine presence.at the east] Implying that the entrance was on the east side. Man is driven out eastward, in accordance with the prevalent belief that the cradle of human civilization was to be sought for in the east.Assyrian Winged Bull.the Cherubim] Mentioned here without explanation, as if their character must be well known to the readers. The O.T. contains two representations of the Cherubim: (1) they are beings who uphold the throne of God, cf. 1 Samuel 4:4, 2 Samuel 6:2, 2 Kings 19:15, Psalm 80:2; Psalm 99:1; possibly, in this aspect, they were originally the personification of the thunder clouds, cf. Psalm 18:10. â\\x80\\x9cAnd he (Jehovah), rode upon a cherub, and did fly,â\\x80\\x9d where the passage is describing the Majesty of Jehovah in the thunderstorm: (2) they are symbols of the Divine Presence, e.g. two small golden cherubim upon the Ark of the Covenant, Exodus 25:18 ff.; two large-winged creatures made of olive wood, sheltering the Ark in the Holy of Holies, 1 Kings 6:23. They were represented in the works of sacred art in the Tabernacle, Exodus 25:18 ff.: and on the walls and furniture of the Temple, 1 Kings 6:29; 1 Kings 6:35; 1 Kings 7:29; 1 Kings 7:36, cf. Ezekiel 41:18 ff.The description of the four living creatures in Ezekiel 1:5 ff; Ezekiel 10:20 ff., gives us the Prophetâ\\x80\\x99s conception of the Cherubim, each one with four faces (of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle), and each one with four wings. But in Ezekiel 41:18-19 the Cherubim have two faces, one of a man, and one of a lion. It is natural to compare the Assyrian composite figures, winged bulls, and lions with menâ\\x80\\x99s heads, and the Greek Î³Ï\\x81Ï\\x8dÏ\\x88, or â\\x80\\x9cgryphon.â\\x80\\x9d In the present passage, the Cherubim are placed as sentinels at the approach to the Tree of Life, and, therefore, we are probably intended to understand that they stood, one on either side of the entrance to the garden, like the two winged figures at the entrance of an Assyrian temple. They are emblematical of the presence of the Almighty: they are the guardians of His abode.the flame of a sword] It is not usually noticed that we have in these words a protection for the Tree of Life quite distinct from the Cherubim. The hasty reader supposes that the â\\x80\\x9cswordâ\\x80\\x9d is a weapon carried by the Cherubim. In pictures, the sword with the flame turning every way is put into the hand of a watching Angel. But this misrepresents the language of the original Hebrew, which states that God placed, at the east of the garden, not only the Cherubim, but also â\\x80\\x9cthe flame of a sword which turned every way.â\\x80\\x9d What the writer intended to convey we can only conjecture. Very probably it was a representation of the lightnings which went forth from the Divine Presence, and were symbolical of unapproachable purity and might.The student should refer to the description of the Cherub, in Ezekiel 28:11-19, and note particularly the words, Genesis 3:13, â\\x80\\x9cthou wast in Eden, the garden of God,â\\x80\\x9d Genesis 3:14, â\\x80\\x9cthou wast the anointed Cherub that covereth: and I set thee, so that thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.â\\x80\\x9d (See Davidsonâ\\x80\\x99s Notes, in loc. in Cambridge Bible.)The LXX Ï\\x84á½´Î½ Ï\\x86Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î½Î·Î½ á¿¥Î¿Î¼Ï\\x86Î±Î¯Î±Î½ Ï\\x84á½´Î½ Ï\\x83Ï\\x84Ï\\x81ÎµÏ\\x86Î¿Î¼Î\\xadÎ½Î·Î½, and Lat. flammeum gladium atque versatilem, give a good rendering of the original.to keep the way of the tree of life] That is to â\\x80\\x9ckeep,â\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cprotect,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cthe way that led to the tree of life,â\\x80\\x9d so that man should not set foot upon it.In the N.T. â\\x80\\x9cthe tree of lifeâ\\x80\\x9d is mentioned Revelation 2:7, â\\x80\\x9cto him that overcometh, to him will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God,â\\x80\\x9d cf. Genesis 22:2.NOTE ON THE FALLI. The following illustrations of the Story of the Fall are from Jeremias (O.T. in the Light of the Ancient East, E.T.).(a) In Mexican mythology the first woman is called â\\x80\\x9cthe woman with the serpent,â\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cthe woman of our flesh,â\\x80\\x9d and she has twin sons.â\\x80¦ In the same way the Indians have a divine first mother of the race of man, who dwells in Paradise (the Indian Meru). Also in the beginning the evil demon Mahishasura fought with the serpent, trod upon and cut off his head; a victory to be repeated at the end of the world, when Brahma will give back to Indra the rulership over all.â\\x80¦ The Chinese have a myth according to which Fo-hi, the first man, discovered the wisdom of Yang and Yin, masculine and feminine principle (heaven and earth).â\\x80¦ A dragon rose from the deep and taught him. â\\x80\\x9cThe woman,â\\x80\\x9d it is said in an explanatory gloss, â\\x80\\x9cis the first source and the root of all evilâ\\x80\\x9d (p. 231).(b) Legend of Eabani. The [Babylonian] epic of Gilgamesh tells about a friend of the hero, reminiscent of Pan and Priapus, Eabani, whose whole body was covered with hair. He is the creation of Aruru when she â\\x80\\x9cbroke off clayâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cmade an image of Anu.â\\x80\\x9d He is a being of a gigantic strength. â\\x80\\x9cWith the gazelles he eats green plants, with the cattle he satisfies himself (?) with drink, with the fish (properly crowd) he is happy in the water. He spoils the hunting of the â\\x80\\x98hunter.â\\x80\\x99 Out of love to the animals he destroys snares and nets (?), so that the wild beasts escape. Then by the craft of the hunter, who feared him, a woman is brought to him, who seduces him, and keeps him from his companions the beasts, for six days and seven nights. When he came back, all beasts of the field fled from him. Then Eabani followed the woman, and let himself be led into the city of Erech. In the following passages of the epic the woman appears as the cause of his troubles and sorrows. A later passage records that Eabani cursed her. The First Man is not in question here, but a certain relationship of idea in this description to the story of the happy primeval state of Adam must be grantedâ\\x80\\x9d (p. 232 f.).(c) Legend of Adapa. Adapa, the son of Ã\\x8aa, was one day fishing when â\\x80\\x9cthe south wind suddenly overturned his boat and he fell into the sea. Adapa in revenge broke the wings of the south wind (the bird Zu), so that he could not fly for seven days. Anu, God of Heaven, called him to account, saying, â\\x80\\x98No mercy!â\\x80\\x99 but at the prayer of Tammuz and Gishzida, Watchers of the Gate, Anu softened his anger, and commanded that a banquet should be prepared, and a festival garment presented to him, and oil for his anointing: garment and oil he accepted, but food and drink he refused. Ã\\x8aa had warned him: â\\x80\\x98When thou appearest before Anu, they will offer thee food of Death: eat not thereof! Water of Death will they offer thee: drink not thereof! They will present thee with a garment: put it on! They will offer thee oil: anoint thyself with it!â\\x80\\x99 But, behold, it was Bread of Life and Water of Life! Anu breaks forth in wonder. Upon the man who has been permitted by his creator to gaze into the secrets of heaven and earth â\\x80¦, he (Anu) has desired to bestow also immortality. And by the envy of the God the man has been deceivedâ\\x80\\x9d (p. 183 f.).Jastrow remarks upon this legend: â\\x80\\x9cAdam, it will be recalled, after eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, makes a garment for himself. There can be no doubt that there is a close connection between this tradition and the feature in the Adapa legend, where Adapa, who has been shown the â\\x80\\x98secrets of heaven and earth,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94that is, has acquired knowledgeâ\\x80\\x94is commanded by Ã\\x8aa to put on the garment that is offered him. The anointing oneself with oil, though an essential part of the toilet in the ancient and modern Orient, was discarded in the Hebrew tale as a superfluous feature. The idea conveyed by the use of oil was the same as the one indicated in clothing oneâ\\x80\\x99s nakedness. Both are symbols of civilization which man is permitted to attain, but his development stops there. He cannot secure eternal lifeâ\\x80\\x9d (Religion of B. and A., p. 552 f.).In this legend, the man Adapa who has acquired â\\x80\\x9cknowledge,â\\x80\\x9d is prevented by the deceit of Ã\\x8aa, the creator of man, from acquiring immortality. There is therefore a striking parallelism of idea with the narrative of Genesis 3, but there is no resemblance in its general features.Hitherto there has not been discovered any Babylonian story of the Fall. But, when we observe the occurrence of such features as â\\x80\\x9cthe garden,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cthe tree of life,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cthe serpent,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cthe Cherubim,â\\x80\\x9d it is clear that the symbolism employed is that which is quite common in the records and representations of Assyrian and Babylonian myths.II. The Story of the Fall does not offer an explanation for the origin of sin. But (1) it gives a description of the first sin; and (2) it presents an explanation of (a) the sense of shame (Genesis 3:7), (b) the toil of man (Genesis 3:17-19), (c) the birth-pangs of woman (Genesis 3:16), (d) the use of clothing (Genesis 3:21). Whether it offers an explanation of the origin of death, is doubtful. The penalty of death, threatened in Genesis 2:17, was not carried out. In Genesis 3:19 it is assumed that man will die, if he does not eat of the tree of life. He is not, therefore, created immortal; yet immortality is not impossible for him.The story turns upon manâ\\x80\\x99s eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. What is this â\\x80\\x9cknowledge of good and evilâ\\x80\\x9d? Four answers have been given. (1) Initiation into the mysteries of magical knowledge. (2) Transition to the physical maturity of which the sense of shame is the natural symptom (Genesis 3:7). (3) Acquisition of the knowledge of the secrets of nature and the gifts of civilization, e.g. clothing (Genesis 3:21), arts, industries, &c.; (Genesis 4:17 ff.). (4) Arrival at the moral sense of discernment between right and wrong.Of these, (1) the first may at once be dismissed as quite alien to the general tenour of the story.(2) The second emphasizes one feature in the story (Genesis 3:7; Genesis 3:10; Genesis 3:21), the sense of shame on account of nakedness. But this new consciousness of sex is only one symptom of the results of disobedience. As an explanation, though possibly adequate for some earlier version of the story, it fails to satisfy the requirements of its present religious character.(3) The third explanation goes further. It supposes that the knowledge is of that type which afterwards characterizes the descendants of Cain (Genesis 4:17 ff.). It implies the expansion of culture with deliberate defiance of Godâ\\x80\\x99s will. It means, then, simply the intellectual knowledge of â\\x80\\x9ceverything,â\\x80\\x9d or, in the Babylonian phrase, of the â\\x80\\x9csecrets of heaven and earth.â\\x80\\x9d Cf. Jastrow, p. 553 n.(4) The fourth explanation has been objected to on the ground that God could not originally have wished to exclude man from the power of discerning between good and evil. Notwithstanding, it seems to be the one most in harmony with the general religious character of the story, which turns upon the act of disobedience to Godâ\\x80\\x99s command, and upon the assertion of manâ\\x80\\x99s will against the Divine. It may, of course, fairly be asked whether the fact of prohibition did not assume the existence of a consciousness of the difference between right and wrong. We need not expect the story to be psychologically scientific. But the prohibition was laid down in manâ\\x80\\x99s condition of existence previous to temptation. It was possible to receive a Divine command without realizing the moral effect of disobedience. The idea of violating that command had not presented itself before the Serpent suggested it. Conscience was not created, but its faculties were instantaneously aroused into activity, by disobedience. â\\x80\\x9cIt is not the thought of the opposition and difference between good and evil â\\x80¦, but it is the experience of evil, that knowledge of good and evil which arises from man having taken evil into his very being, which brings death with it. Man, therefore, ought to know evil only as a possibility that he has overcome; he ought only to see the forbidden fruit; but if he eats it, his death is in the act.â\\x80\\x9d (Martensen, Christian Dogmatics, p. 156.)III. (a) It does not appear that the Story of the Fall is elsewhere alluded to in the Old Testament. The passages in Job 31:33, â\\x80\\x9cIf like Adam I covered my transgressions,â\\x80\\x9d Hosea 6:7, â\\x80\\x9cBut they like Adam have transgressed the covenant,â\\x80\\x9d are doubtful exceptions. But, in all probability, in both cases the rendering of adam, not as a proper name, but as â\\x80\\x9cmanâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cmen,â\\x80\\x9d is to be preferred. There is, indeed, a reference to the â\\x80\\x9cgarden of Edenâ\\x80\\x9d tradition in Ezekiel 28:1[8] But there is no instance, either in the prophetical or sapiential writings, in which the Story of the Fall is made the basis for instruction upon the subject of sin and its consequences. â\\x80\\x9cThe Old Testament,â\\x80\\x9d as Mr Tennant says2[9], â\\x80\\x9csupplies no trace of the existence, among the sacred writers, of any interpretation of the Fall-story comparable to the later doctrine of the Fall.â\\x80\\x9d At the same time, there is no ancient literature comparable to the writings of the O.T. for the deep consciousness of the sinfulness of man in Godâ\\x80\\x99s sight.[8] Micah 7:17, â\\x80\\x9cto lick the dust like a serpent,â\\x80\\x9d is an illustration of Genesis 3:14 rather than an allusion to the story.[9] The Fall and Original Sin, p. 93.The later Jewish literature shews how prominently the subject of the first sin and of manâ\\x80\\x99s depravity entered into the thought and discussions of the Jews in the last century b.c. and in the first century a.d.(b) The most notable of the passages referring to the Fall, which illustrate the theology of St Paul, are as follows:Romans 5:12-14, â\\x80\\x9cTherefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned:â\\x80\\x94for until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adamâ\\x80\\x99s transgression, who is a figure of him that was to come.â\\x80\\x9d Genesis 3:18, â\\x80\\x9cFor as through the one manâ\\x80\\x99s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous.â\\x80\\x9d 1 Corinthians 15:21-22, â\\x80\\x9cFor since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.â\\x80\\x9d 2 Corinthians 11:3, â\\x80\\x9cThe serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness.â\\x80\\x9d 1 Timothy 2:14, â\\x80\\x9cAdam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression.â\\x80\\x9dIn Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 St Paul compares the consequences of the Fall of Adam with the consequences of the redemptive work of Christ. Adamâ\\x80\\x99s Fall brought with it sin and death: Christâ\\x80\\x99s justifying Act brought righteousness and life. The effects of Adamâ\\x80\\x99s sin were transmitted to his descendants. Sin, the tendency to sin, and death, became in consequence universal. But the effect of Adamâ\\x80\\x99s Fall has been cancelled by the work of Grace, by the Death and Resurrection of Christ.For a full discussion of St Paulâ\\x80\\x99s treatment of the Fall, see Sanday and Headlamâ\\x80\\x99s Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans (chap. v.), Bishop Goreâ\\x80\\x99s Lectures on the Romans (vol. i. pp. 185 ff.), Thackerayâ\\x80\\x99s St Paul and Jewish Thought (chap. ii.), Tennantâ\\x80\\x99s The Fall and Original Sin (chap. xi.), Bernardâ\\x80\\x99s article Fall in Hastingsâ\\x80\\x99 D.B. (vol. i.).(c) The following passages, quoted from Charlesâ\\x80\\x99 Apocrypha, will illustrate Jewish religious thought upon the subject of the Fall and its consequences:Wis 2:23-24, â\\x80\\x9cBecause God created man for incorruption, and made him an image of his own proper being; But by the envy of the devil death entered into the world, and they that belong to his realm; experience it.â\\x80\\x9dSir 25:24, â\\x80\\x9cFrom a woman did sin originate, and because of her we must all die.â\\x80\\x9d4 Ezra 3:21, â\\x80\\x9cAnd to him [Adam] thou commandedst only one observance of thine, but he transgressed it. Forthwith thou appointedst death for him and for his generations.â\\x80\\x9d4 Ezra 3:21, â\\x80\\x9cFor the first Adam, clothing himself with the evil heart, transgressed and was overcome; and likewise also all who were born of him. Thus the infirmity became inveterate; the Law indeed was in the heart of the people, but (in conjunction) with the evil germ; so what was good departed.â\\x80\\x9d Cf. 4:30, 31.4 Ezra 7:118, â\\x80\\x9cO thou Adam, what hast thou done! For though it was thou that sinned, the fall was not thine alone, but ours also who are thy descendants!â\\x80\\x9d2 Baruch xvii. 2, 3, â\\x80\\x9cFor what did it profit Adam that he lived nine hundred and thirty years, and transgressed that which he was commanded? Therefore the multitude of time that he lived did not profit him, but brought death, and cut off the years of those who were born from him.â\\x80\\x9d2 Baruch xxiii. 4, â\\x80\\x9cWhen Adam sinned and death was decreed against those who should be born.â\\x80\\x9d2 Baruch xlviii. 42, â\\x80\\x9cO Adam, what hast thou done to all those who are born from thee? And what will be said to the first Eve who hearkened to the Serpent?â\\x80\\x9d2 Baruch liv. 15, 19, â\\x80\\x9cThough Adam first sinned and brought untimely death upon all, yet of those who were born from him each one of them has prepared for his own soul torment to come.â\\x80¦ Adam is therefore not the cause, save only of his own soul, But each of us has been the Adam of his own soul.â\\x80\\x9d2 Baruch lvi. 6, â\\x80\\x9cFor when he [Adam] transgressed, untimely death came into being.â\\x80\\x9dIt will be observed that in some of these passages, e.g. 2 Baruch liv. 15, 19, the spiritual consequences of Adamâ\\x80\\x99s Fall are in the main limited to Adam himself. Jewish thought was not agreed upon the question whether all men inherited from Adam a tendency to sin, or whether each man enjoyed freedom of choice and responsibility. Both views could be supported from St Paulâ\\x80\\x99s words, â\\x80\\x9cThrough the disobedience of the one the many were made sinners,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned.â\\x80\\x9d(d) The teaching of the Talmud is summed up by Weber: â\\x80\\x9cFree will remained to man after the Fall. There is such a thing as transmission of guilt, but not a transmission of sin (es gibt eine Erbschuld, aber keine ErbsÃ¼nde); the fall of Adam occasioned death to the whole race, but not sinfulness in the sense of a necessity to sin. Sin is the result of the decision of each individual; as experience shows it is universal, but in itself even after the Fall it was not absolutely necessaryâ\\x80\\x9d (quoted by Thackeray, ut supra, p. 38). Compare the Midrash Bemidbar Rabba, chap. xiii.; â\\x80\\x9cWhen Adam transgressed the command of the Holy One, and ate of the tree, the Holy One demanded of him penitence, thereby revealing to him the means of freedom (i.e. from the result of his sin), but Adam would not show penitence.â\\x80\\x9d(e) Christian doctrine has been much influenced by the teaching of the Fall. But it is not too much to say that speculation upon Original Sin and the effects of the Fall of Adam has too often been carried into subtleties that have no warrant either in Holy Scripture or in reason. â\\x80\\x9cSpeaking broadly, the Greek view was simply that â\\x80\\x98the original righteousnessâ\\x80\\x99 of the race was lost; the effect of Adamâ\\x80\\x99s sin was a privatio, an impoverishment of human nature which left the power of the will unimpaired. But the Latin writers who followed Augustine took a darker view of the consequences of the Fall. It is for them a depravatio naturae; the human will is disabled; there is left a bias towards evil which can be conquered only by grace.â\\x80\\x9d (Bernard, art. Fall, D.B.)According to St Augustine, Adamâ\\x80\\x99s sin was the abandonment of God, and his punishment was abandonment by God. Adam forfeited the adjutorium of grace. His will was no longer capable of good. In virtue of the â\\x80\\x9ccorporate personalityâ\\x80\\x9d of Adam, all in Adam sinned voluntarily in him. All shared his guilt. This idea of the whole race being tainted with Adamâ\\x80\\x99s act of sin, rests partly upon the exaggerated emphasis laid upon the Roman legal phrase of â\\x80\\x9cimputation,â\\x80\\x9d partly upon the mistranslation, â\\x80\\x9cin quo,â\\x80\\x9d of St Paulâ\\x80\\x99s words á¼\\x90Ï\\x86Ê¼ á¾§ Ï\\x80Î¬Î½Ï\\x84ÎµÏ\\x82 á¼¥Î¼Î±Ï\\x81Ï\\x84Î¿Î½, as if it were â\\x80\\x9cin whom all sinned,â\\x80\\x9d instead of â\\x80\\x9cin that all sinned.â\\x80\\x9dThe Fathers very generally held that original righteousness, which combined natural innocence and the grace of God granted to Adam, was lost at the Fall: and that man, therefore, lost primaeval innocence and the Divine Spirit simultaneously.(f) Thomas Aquinas went still further in the systematization of the doctrine. Mr Wheeler Robinson gives the following summary: â\\x80\\x9cThe immediate result of the Fall was the loss of manâ\\x80\\x99s original righteousness, that is, of the harmonious inter-relation of his nature, through the complete withdrawal of the gift of grace and the decrease of his inclination to virtue (I. b, Q. lxxxv. 1). The disorder of his nature, when uncontrolled by grace, shews itself materially in concupiscentia and formally in the want of original righteousness (I. b, Q. lxxxii. 3), these two elements constituting the â\\x80\\x98original sinâ\\x80\\x99 which passed to Adamâ\\x80\\x99s descendants with the accompanying â\\x80\\x98guiltâ\\x80\\x99 (I. b, lxxxi. 3).â\\x80¦ all men are one, through the common nature they receive from Adam. As in the individual the will moves the several members, so in the race the will of Adam moves those sprung from himâ\\x80\\x9d (I. b, lxxxi. 1). (The Christian Doctrine of Man, p. 206 f.)The Council of Trent, Sessio Quinta Â§Â§ 2, 3, June 17, 1546, in the â\\x80\\x9cDecree concerning Original Sin,â\\x80\\x9d laid down the following dogma: â\\x80\\x9cIf any one asserts that the prevarication of Adam injured himself alone, and not his posterity; and that the holiness and justice, received of God, which he lost, he lost for himself alone, and not for us also; or that he, being defiled by the sin of disobedience, has only transfused death and pains of the body into the human race, but not sin also, which is the death of the soul; let him be anathema: whereas he contradicts the apostle who says: By one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death, and so death passed upon all men, in whom (in quo) all have sinnedâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80¦ â\\x80\\x9cthis sin of Adam,â\\x80\\x94which in its origin is one, and being transfused into all by propagation, not by imitation, is in each one as his own.â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d (Schaffâ\\x80\\x99s Creeds of the Gr. and Lat. Churches, p. 85.)(g) XXXIX Articles. â\\x80\\x9cOriginal sin standeth not in the following of Adam (as the Pelagians do vainly talk), but it is the fault and corruption (vitium et depravatio) of the nature of every man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam, whereby man is very far gone (quam longissime distet) from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to do evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit, and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth Godâ\\x80\\x99s wrath and damnation. And this infection (depravatio) of nature doth remain, yea in them that are regenerated (in renatis).â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d (Art. ix. Of original or Birth Sin.)â\\x80\\x9cThe condition of man after the fall of Adam (post lapsum Adae) is such that he cannot turn and prepare himself by his own natural strength and good works, to faith and calling upon God.â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d (Art. x. Free Will.)For a valuable series of discussions, in which traditional Christian doctrine respecting â\\x80\\x9cOriginal Sinâ\\x80\\x9d and the â\\x80\\x9cFall of Adamâ\\x80\\x9d is criticized, see The Origin and Propagation of Sin (1909), The Sources of the Doctrines of the Fall and Original Sin (1903), The Concept of Sin (1912) by the Rev. F. R. Tennant, D.D., B.Sc., Cambridge University Press.The problem has very largely been modified by modern enquiry, both as regards the origin of the race and the character of the Scripture narrative. Christian doctrine is no longer fettered by the methods of the Schoolmen. Modern philosophy of religion, assisted by the newer studies of sociology, anthropology, and comparative religion, is beginning to revise our conceptions both of personality and of sin. It is inevitable, that, in the larger horizon which has opened up, the attempt should be made to restate Christian thought in reference to the nature of â\\x80\\x9csin,â\\x80\\x9d of â\\x80\\x9cguilt,â\\x80\\x9d and of â\\x80\\x9cpersonal freedom.â\\x80\\x9dIn conclusion, the following extract from Sanday and Headlamâ\\x80\\x99s Note on Romans 5:12-21 (p. 146 f.) will repay the studentâ\\x80\\x99s careful consideration:â\\x80\\x9cThe tendency to sin is present in every man who is born into the world. But the tendency does not become actual sin until it takes effect in defiance of an express command, in deliberate disregard of a known distinction between right and wrong. How men came to be possessed of such a command, by what process they arrived at the conscious distinction of right and wrong, we can but vaguely speculate. Whatever it was, we may be sure that it could not have been presented to the imagination of primitive peoples otherwise than in such simple forms as the narrative assumes in the Book of Genesis. The really essential truths all come out in that narrativeâ\\x80\\x94the recognition of the Divine Will, the act of disobedience to the Will so recognised, the perpetuation of the tendency to such disobedience; and we may add perhaps, though here we get into a region of surmises, the connexion between moral evil and physical decay, for the surest pledge of immortality is the relation of the highest part of us, the soul, through righteousness to God. These salient principles, which may have been due in fact to a process of gradual accretion through long periods, are naturally and inevitably summed up as a group of single incidents. Their essential character is not altered, and in the interpretation of primitive beliefs we may safely remember that â\\x80\\x98a thousand years in the sight of God are but as one day.â\\x80\\x99 We who believe in Providence and who believe in the active influence of the Spirit of God upon man, may well also believe that the tentative gropings of the primaeval savage were assisted and guided and so led up to definite issues, to which he himself perhaps at the time could hardly give a name but which he learnt to call â\\x80\\x98sinâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98disobedience,â\\x80\\x99 and the tendency to which later ages also saw to have been handed on from generation to generation in a way which we now describe as â\\x80\\x98heredity.â\\x80\\x99 It would be absurd to expect the language of modern science in the prophet who first incorporated the traditions of his race in the Sacred Books of the Hebrews. He uses the only kind of language available to his own intelligence and that of his contemporaries. But if the language which he does use is from that point of view abundantly justified, then the application which St Paul makes of it is equally justified. He, too, expresses truth through symbols, and in the days when men can dispense with symbols his teaching may be obsolete, but not before.â\\x80\\x9dThe Cambridge Bible for Schools and CollegesText Courtesy of BibleSupport.com.

Genesis 10:1, Genesis 9:19. The word rendered â\\x80\\x9cdividedâ\\x80\\x9d is different from that in Genesis 10:25, but is the same as that which is found in Genesis 10:5.

      "('Genesis 11:32', ['And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.32. two hundred and five years] For this figure the Samaritan version gives 145, obviously in order to make the year of Abramâ\\x80\\x99s departure from Haran (when Abram was 75 years old; see Genesis 12:4) coincide with the year of Terahâ\\x80\\x99s death, since Abram was born (Genesis 11:26) in Terahâ\\x80\\x99s 70th year. It is this tradition which is followed by Stephen, Acts 7:4.In this Table it is possible to follow the different chronologies of the Massoretic, Samaritan, and Septuagint Text (L = Lucian).(a) The Samaritan Text (except in the case of Shem, Nahor, and Terah) adds 100 years to the ages at the birth of the firstborn: in the case of Nahor, it adds 50.The Septuagint Text does the same.(b) The Samaritan Text (except in the case of Shem, Eber, Nahor, and Terah) deducts 100 years from the ages subsequent to the birth of the firstborn; in the case of Eber it deducts 160 years; in the case of Nahor it deducts 50 years; in the case of Terah it deducts 60 years.The Septuagint Text adds in the case of Arpachshad 27 years; and of Nahor 10 years; and deducts in the case of Shelah 73 years, and of Eber 60 years.(c) In chap. 11 only nine generations are recorded, as against ten in chap. 5. The Septuagint, by inserting Cainan, secures the number ten.(d) It will be noticed that the ages of the Shemite Patriarchs become greatly diminished in duration after Eber.(e) The difficulty, occasioned by Genesis 11:32 (Terahâ\\x80\\x99s death in Haran at the age of 205), and by Genesis 12:4 (Abramâ\\x80\\x99s departure from Haran at the age of 75, when Terah was 145 years old (cf. Genesis 11:26)), is obviated in the Samaritan Text, according to which Terah died at the age of 145, the year of Abramâ\\x80\\x99s departure.The Cambridge Bible for Schools and CollegesText Courtesy of BibleSupport.com.

Traces of similar beliefs may perhaps be detected among the civilised races of antiquity.â\\x80\\x9d Frazer quotes, in illustration, Job 31:11 sq., and the two narratives of Genesis 12:10-20; Genesis 20:1-18. â\\x80\\x9cThese narratives,â\\x80\\x9d he says, â\\x80\\x9cseem to imply that adultery, even when it is committed in ignorance, is a cause of plague and especially of sterility among women.â\\x80\\x9dThe Cambridge Bible for Schools and CollegesText Courtesy of BibleSupport.com.

Exodus 32:9-14; Numbers 14:15-20; Amos 7:4-6. In all these cases, he that intercedes seeks, on the one hand, to enter into the mind of God in His holiness and in His mercy; and then, on the other, to be the spokesman and representative of the community whose sin he confesses, and in whose behalf he entreats forgiveness and deliverance.The Cambridge Bible for Schools and CollegesText Courtesy of BibleSupport.com.

      "('Genesis 19:38', ['And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.38. Ben-ammi] â\\x80\\x9cThe son of my peopleâ\\x80\\x9d; or â\\x80\\x9cthe son of my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s kinâ\\x80\\x9d; see Genesis 17:14. â\\x80\\x9cUnto this day,â\\x80\\x9d cf. Genesis 26:33, Genesis 32:32, Genesis 35:20, Genesis 47:26 (J).There is no need for us to regard this repulsive story as literal history. It should be included among the popular narratives which grew up round the traditional origin of proper names. It has been held that the tradition may have had a local Moabite origin connected with some famous cavern, and that the people of Moab and Ammon may have had an old belief that their races arose in prehistoric times from the same ancestor, in accordance with this tale. Undoubtedly, there were ancient Eastern peoples to whom the incest here described would have seemed in no way atrocious.It is, of course, also possible, that the story, as we have it in Gen., reflects the feelings of bitterness and hatred which were felt among the Israelites towards their neighbours on the east side of the Jordan. The antipathy expressed in Deuteronomy 23:3 and Nehemiah 13:1-2 may well account for the circulation of traditions concerning the parentage of these two peoples, combining a popular explanation of their names with contumely and reproach as to their origin.Again, it is conceivable that this story may contain a fragment of a tradition, Moabite and Ammonite in its derivation, which recorded some stupendous catastrophe, from which, through the favour of the Deity, only Lot and his daughters, out of all the inhabitants of the world, were saved. The story may then have been regarded as reflecting not ignominy, but honour, upon those who were the means of preserving the whole human race from the peril of extinction. There is plausibility in this theory of Gunkelâ\\x80\\x99s. The words of the elder daughter, â\\x80\\x9cthere is not a man,â\\x80\\x9d seem to imply that all the inhabitants of the earth had been annihilated. Our ignorance of Moabite early traditions forbids us to go further than to admit the possibility of some such explanation.The Cambridge Bible for Schools and CollegesText Courtesy of BibleSupport.com.

A large mosque has been erected over it. In 1869 the Prussian Crown Prince Frederick, and in 1881 the late King Edward VII, who was then Prince of Wales, received permission to visit the cave. But, as a rule, Christians are not allowed to view it.The Cambridge Bible for Schools and CollegesText Courtesy of BibleSupport.com. Used by Permission.

Literally it means â\\x80\\x9cinto the tent Sarah his mother,â\\x80\\x9d a grammatical impossibility. It can hardly be questioned that the words â\\x80\\x9cSarah his motherâ\\x80\\x9d are a gloss upon the word â\\x80\\x9ctent,â\\x80\\x9d which has found its way into the text.The tent would be either Isaacâ\\x80\\x99s, or the chief tent in the womenâ\\x80\\x99s quarters. Cf. Genesis 31:33. This would explain the gloss.after his motherâ\\x80\\x99s death] Once more the text seems to be doubtful. The literal translation of the Heb. is â\\x80\\x9cafter his motherâ\\x80\\x9d: and the phrase is intolerably harsh. The versions have paraphrased the sentence.

      "('Genesis 25:34', ['Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.34. lentils] The pottage here described is made of a small reddish kind of bean much in use for food in Palestine, Arab. â\\x80\\x98adas. Cf. 2 Samuel 17:28; 2 Samuel 23:11; Ezekiel 4:9. It makes the reddish pottage now called in Palestine mujedderah, a very popular dish.so Esau despised his birthright] These words summarize the narrative. Esauâ\\x80\\x99s character is portrayed as that of a careless, shallow man, living from hand to mouth, and paying no regard to things of higher or spiritual significance. It is this trait which is referred to in Hebrews 12:16, â\\x80\\x9cor profane person as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.â\\x80\\x9d The advantage of the birthright may have been indefinite. But, as we may judge not only from the story in ch. 27, but also from that of Genesis 38:28-30 and Genesis 48:13-19 (cf. Deuteronomy 21:15-17), the privilege of the birthright was accounted sacred in the social life of the early Israelite. The Lat. paraphrases the sense of the last clause, parvi pendens quod primogenita vendidisset.The birthright was Esauâ\\x80\\x99s by Godâ\\x80\\x99s gift, not by his own merit. Hence it symbolized eternal blessing. Esauâ\\x80\\x99s repudiation of the unseen and intangible, for the sake of immediate self-gratification, is the symbol of a large proportion of human sin and thoughtlessness.The Cambridge Bible for Schools and CollegesText Courtesy of BibleSupport.com.
